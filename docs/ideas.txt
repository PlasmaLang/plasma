== Ideas to consider

Many of these should also wait until later.  But this category is separate
as I'm not sure that these are good ideas.

GC::
  * Regions
  * Mark-compact for acyclic objects

Optimisations::
  * Convert ANF to relaxed ANF then to PZ.  Use the relaxed ANF to find
    single use variables and optimize them away to generate more efficient PZ.
    Do some other def-use analysis too, including for parallel tasks.

Types::
  * Use structural matching to some degree, an instance can implement more
    than one interface, and may define more than an interface requires.
  * When supporting interfaces, maybe they can be integrated with the
    package system in a kind-of "does this package provide X?"
  * Evaluate HKTs.
  * Refinement types / path-aware constraints.
  * Use symbols like ? for maybe and | for or, like Flow Types.
  * Consider safe/unsafe integer operations such as overflows, division by
    zero etc.  Allow checking for error to be done at the end of a
    complex calculation or by throwing an exception.
  + When implementing more subtyping, during an ambigious type which the
    value of a match expression, prefer the type (if there is one) that allows
    the match to "cover" the whole type, and provide that as guidance to the
    solver.

Syntax::
  * Add field update and conditional field update syntax.
  * Maybe remove parens from if-then-else conditions and other places such as
    match parameters.
  * Guards on cases
  * Disjunctive patterns on cases
  * SISAL allows "masks" (like guards or filters) on returns clauses of
    loops.  This looks pretty powerful.
  * More succinct loop syntax, for simpler loops.
  * Maybe allow simple loop outputs to be specified in the loop "head".
  * Consider different syntax & and ,? for combining multiple loop inputs in
    lockstep or Cartesian combinations.
  * List, array and sequence comprehensions.
  * Add a scope statement that contains a block allowing shadowing of some
    variables, and hiding of any produced variables.
  * Add let expressions?
  * Add something to allow statements within expressions?
  * Probably drop { } for dictionary constants in favor of [ ] with a => to
    separate keys from values.
  + Add more logical operators to the langauge, maybe xor and implication,
    probably via keywords or functions rather than symbols.

Other::
  * Predicate expressions as a syntax sugar for applicative.
  * Read about Facebook reason wrt naming things and syntax.
  * Use command line parsing as example code for language & library.
