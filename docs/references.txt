Potentially useful references from this book::
* Appel 1989b, Goldberg 1991 about pointer finding
* Looks like Appel has several good papers about GC
* Tarditi Compressing stack maps.

=== Type systems

* https://www.mpi-sws.org/~rossberg/1ml/[1ML] is an ML language with the
  module language and value language unified into one language (I think) I
  need to read more.

* http://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.01895.pdf[Modular Implicits] is an extension to
  OCaml to add ad-hoc polymorphism to the language.  This is similar to my
  vague ideas about implicit
  link:plasma_ref.html#_interfaces[interfaces],
  and I will probably use this in some way.

* https://www.koterpillar.com/talks/instances-for-everyone/#18 Alexy's talk
  about deriving things like Eq, Ord etc in Haskell/GHC.  Contains further
  links at the end.

=== Optimiation and code gneeration

* Frances Allen, 1971: A cataloge of Optimizing Transformations".

  Inline, Unroll, CSE, DCE, Code Motion, Constant Fold, Peephole.
  Alledgedly these give 80% of the best case of all optimisations.

  Unfortunately I couldn't find this paper.  The referece came from a slide
  deck by Gradon Hoare.

== Libraries

=== Message Passing

Nanomsg::
http://nanomsg.org/
+
Nanomsg is a C library for message passing.  It exposes a BSD sockets style
API.

=== Profiling

SHIM::
https://github.com/ShimProfiler/SHIM
SHIM is a tool for high-resolution sampling of CPU performance counters.  It
may be more useful as a basis of our own implementation than useful as-is.

== Tools

=== Build systems

Autosetup::
http://msteveb.github.io/autosetup/
Autosetup is an alternative to autoconf, it is written in Tcl.

Tup::
http://gittup.org/tup/index.html
Tup is an alternative to Make.  It looks like it avoids a lot of Make's
problems.

=== Git/Project hosting

gitlab::
Software.

gitgud.io::
Gitlab hosted service.

gogs.io::
Git oriented project hosting written in Go.

=== C Static analysis

splint::
http://www.splint.org/

== Algorithms

=== PRNGs

A table of some http://www.pcg-random.org/[PRNGs].

== Related programming languages

Plasma is implemented in https://mercurylang.org[Mercury].

Plasma is inspired by many other languages, some of them are:

* https://mercurylang.org[Mercury] is a logic/functional language that I
  also work on.  I developed an auto-parallelisation system for Mercury and
  plan to implement one for Plasma.  After 7 years contributing to Mercury
  I'm sure other aspects of it will also influence Plasma.
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hope_%28programming_language%29[Hope]
  influenced Plasma indirectly.  Hope is the first language with abstract
  data types.
* http://ocaml.org[OCaml]'s parametric modules are the inspiration for
  Plasma's interfaces.

Several other imperative/declarative languages like Plasma include:

* http://www2.cmp.uea.ac.uk/~jrwg/Sisal/00.Contents.html[SISAL]
* http://mars-lang.appspot.com/[Mars]
* http://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/schachte/papers/wybeintro.pdf[Wybe]
* http://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/lee/src/pawns/[Pawns]

Disclosure: Mars, Wybe and Pawns are all developed by colleagues of mine.

Other parallel languages:

* http://www2.cmp.uea.ac.uk/~jrwg/Sisal/00.Contents.html[SISAL] is an
  applicative single-assignment language, like Plasma it has declarative
  semantics and an imperative-ish style.  It supported auto-parallelisation
  based on loops and streams and rivaled Fortran form performance.
* http://futhark-lang.org[Futhark] is an array based language (like APL) for
  GPGPU programming. I don't know much about it at the moment but will be
  reading their papers and following their work.
* http://halide-lang.org/ A Data-parallel eDSL embedded in C++
* http://parasail-lang.org/ Looks like an implicitly-parallel language.
