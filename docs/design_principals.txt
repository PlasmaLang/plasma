This document is an attempt to write down the guiding principals that we use
when making decisions about the language, and in some cases the
tools/ecosystem.  The intention is that by documenting this it not only gives
us something to refer to but makes decisions more conscious, leading to a more
consistent language.

A lot of these will be described with anti-examples ("don't").  I'd prefer to
use positive examples of how Plasma avoids these problems, and will try to,
however most can only be recognised with these "don't" examples.

== Language syntax

=== Basic consistency

C structs, and C++ classes, must be followed by a semicolon.  But functions
don't need to be.

Haskell uses square brackets for lists:

 * +[]+
 * +[1, 2, 3]+
 * +[a]+ (as a type expression)

But it also uses : for the cons operator, and when pattern matching with lists
code looks like:

----
length [] = 0
length (x:xs) = (length xs) + 1
----

This is inconsistent.  Plasma has chosen the Prolog syntax for "cons"
(+[x | xs]+).

There may be "consistent" reasons why C/C++ and Haskell make these choices.
Indeed +:+ is an operator in Haskell while +[]+ and +[1, 2, 3]+ aren't.
Likewise struct declarations end in a semicolon in C otherwise the next
identifier would be an instance of that struct.  Nevertheless this is
inconsistent _from the point of view of the programmer_.  We will try to
avoid inconsistency, and may need to do this by changing other parts of the
language (if Plasma was C we'd avoid conflating structure definitions with
definitions of struct instances).
 
=== Things should look like what they are / mean what they look like.

The following Mercury code

----
(
    X = a,
    ...
;
    X = b,
    ...
)
----

Could be a switch (with either 0 or 1 answers) a nondet disjunction (with
any number of answers and hard to predict complexity).  The exact meaning of
this depends on the instantiation state of X which depends on the
surrounding code.  You can't tell by looking how this code will behave.

Also in Mercury a goal such as:

----
A = foo(B, C)
----

Could be a test unification (semidet, very fast), a construction (det, with
a memory allocation), a deconstruction (det or semidet), or a function call
(could do anything, including not terminate).

We will try to avoid these in Plasma.  Plasma has no disjunction so the
first is not a problem.  But the second is currently avoided because data
constructors begin with capital letters (this will change, so we may need to
revisit this).

We've been creating a link:concept_map.html[syntax to concept map] we're
trying to avoid overloading symbols (where possible).  For example + means
addition and concatenation in many languages, but in Plasma (like Haskell
and Mercury) ++ means concatenation.

=== Make parsing simple, for machines and humans

To simplify parsing, both for machines and humans, all
declarations/definitions and many statements can be recognised by their
first token.  All type definitions begin with the keyword +type+ all
functions with +func+ etc.  Statements can begin with +if+, +match+,
+return+, +var+ or similar, and those that don't belong to a small set
containing only:

 * Assignment
 * Array assignment
 * Call (with effect)

Which can be disambiguated by the first 2 tokens.

We assume that this also makes it easy for humans to recognise the type of
each statement, at least provided they find the beginning of a statement
which is (by convention, not syntax) at the beginning of a line or on the
same line following a +{+.

This is also related to things being what they look like.

=== Choose the more restrictive alternative

There are many cases where we are unable to decide what is best for the
language, particularly without experience using it in anger.  In these cases
given two or more choice we should choose the most restrictive.  It will be
more pleasant later if we change to a less restrictive option, rather than
_from_ a less restrictive option to a more restrictive one.

For example
https://plasmalang.org/list-archives/dev/2018-January/000026.html[resources
and higher-order code] was a fairly major choice we we've picked one of the
more restrictive options, and might find we need to relax it later.

== General

=== Familiarity

There are two aspects to familiarity.  One is generally using syntax that'll
be more familiar to a majority of programmers in 2019.  We're assuming
people coming to Plasma have at least 2 years experience programming and
they may be "functionally curious".  Syntax for functions follows the
popular curly-brace syntax of C-like languages.

Likewise we use terminology and names that are going to be more familiar.
What Haskell calls "Functor" we shall call "Mappable".  We know this
isn't as accurate as "Functor", but we believe that it being more familiar to
more people is a greater benefit than this level of accuracy.

The second aspect of familiarity is that something may not be familiar to 
most people.  For example Plasma's syntax for ADTs borrows from Haskell,
This syntax may be unfamiliar to the majority, but it's better to be
familiar to those who have seen Haskell than no-one at all.

Likewise some concepts have no familiar meaning (eg Monad).  We carefully
weigh whether to include that concept (we will not include GADTs) and it is
useful enough to include (Monads) we de-emphasise it.

=== Principal of least surprise

This is written about elsewhere online.  Given two alternatives, choose the
one that surprises people the least (when other factors are equal).  You can
see that some of the above principals are specific examples of this one.
