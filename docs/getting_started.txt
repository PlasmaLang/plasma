Since we don’t have static builds yet, you’ll need to build Plasma from source.
This file contains some instructions on setting up the prerequisites and
building Plasma.

Plasma has been tested on Linux, Windows subsystem for Linux 1 and 2 on x86_64.


== Docker

If you want to run Plasma in a Docker container (rather than the
instructions below for Ubuntu Linux) the Dockerfile provided in
https://github.com/PlasmaLang/plasma/tree/master/scripts/docker[scripts/docker] is available,
It is also build and available on
https://hub.docker.com/r/paulbone/plasma-dep[docker hub].
You can resume this "getting started" guide at the
xref:_hello_world[Hello World] section below,
you will still need to adapt some of the instructions for use with the
container.

== Dependencies

You will need

 * GCC or Clang
 * GNU Make
 * git
 * Mercury (tested with 22.01)
 * ninja 1.10 or later
 * asciidoc & source-highlight (if you want to build the documentation)

=== C++ compiler, make and git 

Plasma has been tested with clang and gcc.
On debian-based systems you can install a suitable compiler and GNU Make
with the build-essential package.
Install git at the same time.

[source,bash]
----
sudo apt install build-essential git
----

=== Mercury

You’ll need another language, Mercury, since our compiler is written in it.
A recent stable version is required (22.01.x), ROTD versions may also work.
Plasma's CI currently tests with 22.01.
Compiling Mercury from source can take a long time,
but if you’re on Debian, Ubuntu or other derivative running on x86_64
then there are some packages!
Read on or follow the instructions at https://dl.mercurylang.org/deb/

==== For Ubuntu 20.04, this is what you need to do:

To install Mercury you'll need to add a new package repository & GPG key.
Download and trust Paul's GPG key:

[source,bash]
----
cd /tmp
wget https://paul.bone.id.au/paul.asc
sudo cp paul.asc /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/paulbone.asc
----

Create a new file in /etc/apt/sources.list.d, name it mercury.list and paste
in it:

  deb http://dl.mercurylang.org/deb/ focal main
  deb-src http://dl.mercurylang.org/deb/ focal main

You may need to substitue focal for another name, see the
https://dl.mercurylang.org/deb/[Mercury debian packages page].

.Now we can install:
[source,bash]
----
sudo apt update
sudo apt install mercury-rotd-recommended
----

=== Asciidoc

To optionally build the documentation, you need to install AsciiDoc and
source-highlight:

[source,bash]
----
sudo apt install asciidoc source-highlight
----

Beware, this is a very large installation, on a default Ubuntu installation
this amounts to over 1 GB of space and a download of over 300MB.
If AsciiDoc is not installed, documentation will not be built.

=== ninja

Plasma's build tool `plzbuild` needs least version 1.10 of the ninja build
tool.

Ubuntu 20.04 has a suitable package.

----
sudo apt install ninja-build
----

Or install it yourself from a binary download:
https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/releases

Or from source:
https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/

Or run these commands to install ninja 1.10.2 on your x86_64 Linux system:

----
cd /tmp
wget https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/releases/download/v1.10.2/ninja-linux.zip
unzip ninja-linux.zip
sudo cp ninja /usr/local/bin/
----

== Compiling Plasma

Now it’s time to clone the plasma repo:

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/PlasmaLang/plasma.git
----
If you want or need to, you can configure Plasma's build settings by
copying `template.mk` to `build.mk` and editing it.
It contains some documentation for the build options.
These include which C compiler to use, and compilation flags.
The default build is reasonable if you have `gcc`.
You may need to set the `PREFIX` variable to your desired installation
directory, The Plasma compiler and other tools will be installed to
`$PREFIX/bin/`, you will need to arrange for that to be in your shell
interpreter's path 
(https://github.com/PlasmaLang/plasma/issues/325[bug #325] will remove this
requirement).

Then run `make` and it will build you the plasma compiler (`src/plzc`)
and the runtime (`runtime/plzrun`).
Set `MAKEFLAGS` to build the C++ code in parallel, or set it in your
`~/.bashrc`.

----
NPROC=$(nproc)
export MAKEFLAGS="-j$NPROC -l$NPROC"
make
----

The `make test` command will execute the test suite.
Be sure to take a look at the example programs in 
https://github.com/PlasmaLang/plasma/tree/master/examples[`examples/`].

== Installing Plasma

The `make install` command will now install the Plasma tools into
the `$PREFIX` path you set in `build.mk` in the previous step.
The compiler and other tools are now available under `$PREFIX/bin/`.

Enjoy!

== Hello world

In a new directory create a `BUILD.plz` project file, it should contain:

----
[hello]
type = program
modules = [ Hello ]
----

Create a `hello.p` file to contain the `Hello` module, it should contain:

----
module Hello

entrypoint
func hello() uses IO -> Int {
    print!("Hello world\n")

    return 0
}
----

Then use the plzbuild program to build the program:

----
$ plzbuild
----

This will create a `hello.pz` file in the current directory containing the
program's bytecode.  Run it with:

----
$ plzrun hello.pz
Hello world
----

== Getting help

If you're stuck and  the https://plasmalang.org/docs/[Documentation] doesn't
contain the answer or clue you need or you're struggling to find it.  Please
ask for help.
The https://plasmalang.org/contact.html[Contact] page of the website lists
all the ways you can get in touch.
In particular the
