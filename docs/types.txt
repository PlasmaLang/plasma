This is a design/set of ideas that I'm considering for Plasma's type system.
it is very much a draft.  It is more or less an aide to help me write down
my ideas, work them through and eventually refine then and make them part of
the link:plasma_ref.html[reference manual].

Starting with a type system such as the basic parts of Haskell's or
Mercury's specifically:

* Discriminated unions / ADTs
* Polymorphism
* Abstract types
* Existential types (later)
* More kinds (later)

Starting with this I have been considering the kinds of subtyping that OCaml
can do, it's pretty neat.  But recently I read a
link:https://futhark-lang.org/blog/2017-03-06-futhark-record-system.html[blog
post]
by Troels Henriksen about structural typing and record syntax for Futhark.
It made me consider this more deeply, and now I have the following design in
mind.

== Basic stuff

We can define our own types, such as enums:

----
type Suit = Hearts | Diamonds | Spades | Clubs
----

Or structures, this type has a single struct with named fields.

----
type PlayingCard = Card ( suit : Suit, number : Number )
----

A combination of the above, a PlayingCard is either an ordinary card or a
joker.  An ordinary card has fields.

----
type PlayingCard = OrdinaryCard ( suit : Suit, number : Number )
                 | Joker
----

Types are polymorphic, they may take type parameters.  Identifiers beginning
with upper case letters denote type names and constructor names.
Identifiers beginning with lower-case letters denote type variables.

----
type Tree(k, v) = EmptyTree
                | Node (
                    key     : k,
                    value   : v,
                    left    : Tree(k, v),
                    right   : Tree(k, v)
                )
----

A type alias, ID is now another word for Int. (XXX this needs revisiting).

----
type_alias ID = Int
----

It's often more useful to alias something more complex.

----
type_alias Name = String
type_alias NameMap = Map(ID, Name)
----

Type aliases can take parameters:

----
type_alias IDMap(x) = Map(ID, x)
----

== Terminology

Before we can go further, I want to pin down some terminology.

A type has a name and some parameters.  Eg +Int+ or +Map(k, v)+

A type declaration has multiple parts:

----
type Tree(k, v) = EmptyTree
                | Node (
                    key     : k,
                    value   : v,
                    left    : Tree(k, v),
                    right   : Tree(k, v)
                )
----

A type declaration is made of a left hand side and a right hand side (either
side of the +=+).  The left-hand-side contains a type name +Tree+ it's
parameters +k+ and +v+ which creates the type +Tree(k, v)+.  This is also a
type expression but we'll get to that later.

TODO: kinds.

The right hand side is a structure expression.
A structure expression is normally made up of structures
structures separated by +|+ symbols (meaning "or").  But could be made of
other things such as a reference to another type (+type(TypeExpr)+).
Each structure is made up of an optional structure (the bit in the parens)
and a tag (its name).
The structure is optional, if there are no fields then one should not write
empty parens.
An untagged structure, which we will see later, is written with the +_+ for
its tag.
When an untagged structure is used, there must be exactly one structure in
the type.
Other languages often call the tagged structures data constructors, and the
untagged ones tuples, but I hope that calling them both structures, and
allowing untagged structures to use field names and share some syntax will
be good.

NOTE: The word tag is overloaded, it also refers to an implementation detail
for discriminated unions, that's not what we're referring to here.

Each field in the structure has a name and a type.  The type is any type
expression.  The field name is optional.

Finally type expressions refer either a type like +Map(k, v)+ (including
abstract types), or multiple type expressions separated by +|+,
or arbitrary structure expressions when wrapped in +struct()+. The
+struct()+ wrapper avoids ambiguity between tags and types.  Likewise, and
not mentioned above, structure expressions can refer to whole types with
+type()+.

Any type variables appearing in structures (on the RHS of the = in the type
declaration, must appear exactly once on the LHS.  This may need to change
for existential types (TODO).

== Subtyping / constructors are "shared"

----
type TypeA = A | B
type TypeB = A | B | C
----

A function that accepts parameters of type +TypeA+, cannot be passed
values of +TypeB+.  But a function accepting parameters of type +TypeB+ can
be passed values of +TypeA+.

This works along with type inference.  This function:

----
func my_func() -> _
{
    return A
}
----

Is known to return +A+ which is covered by either +TypeA+ or +TypeB+.  This
functions inferred return type will be +struct(A)+.  Which we know we can
pass as either TypeA or TypeB.  Care will need to be taken when generating
error messages.

Likewise, if +my_func+ was defined as:

----
func my_func(...) -> _
{
    if (...) {
        return A
    } else {
        return B
    }
}
----

Then it would be inferred as returning +TypeA+ since we already have a name
for +struct(A | B)+.

Types defined in separate modules outside the view of each-other can't share
tags.  This is not the limitation it seems, since usually when such a
feature is required it is to extend, or in some cases reduce, the
constructor symbols of an existing known type.

----
type AdvancedNode(a) = type(BasicNode(a))
                     | AdvancedStruct (
                        ...
                     )
----

NOTE: See below for how recursive types are handled.


== Magic type tagging.

I think I saw this in Perl 6.

----
func do_something(...) -> Result | Error
{
    ...
}
----

That's easy provided that both these types have all their structures tagged,
but Ints, Strings, etc don't work like that (each Int, String etc is like an
alternative tag in an infinite or really large set of tags).

Where all the types in a type expression are named, then they may also be
switched by type, rather than just value. (the compiler tags and probably
boxes them internally).

----
func print(x : Int | String) -> String
{
    return switch_type(x) {
        Int -> int_to_string(x)
        String -> "\"" ++ x ++ "\""
    }
}
----


== Ordering

This kind of subtyping must work via an ordering.  There is a partial
ordering over all types, types that refer to something _more specific_ are
_greater_ in this ordering.  Therefore: +A | B+ > +A | B | C+.

Being a partial ordering some types cannot be compared, eg: +A | B+ and +B |
C+.  This means that neither is a subtype of the other.


== Adding fields.

This can vary depending upon how programmers express deconstructions.
Usually a deconstruction is (semantically) a match statement.

----
match (a) {
    A (x) -> { return x }
}
----

The equivlient deconstruction might look like:

----
A(x) = a
return x
----

This matches A with a single field.
It would also match any A with at least one field, extracting only the
first.
Let's make a new structure expression for that: +A/1+, this kind of type
expression wont appear in programs or even error messages, but we need it
here to discuss subtyping and ordering.

But fields can also be extracted or structures can be matched using field
names.

----
# Field selection.
return a.field1

# Match with fields.
match (a) {
    A(x = field1) -> { return x }
}
----

Therefore we also need to talk about subtyping with regard to fields and
their types.  We write the type of a in these as: +struct(A(field1 : t))+
(t is currently abstract).  It's more correct to say that the first is
+struct(_(field1 : t))+ since the constructor symbol isn't mentioned.

Any use of a constructor, such as the match statement but not the field
selection, requires a type to have already been declared.  This will make
more sense later with tagless structures.  For now lets just say we require
a type to exist.

For example, either +TypeA+ or +TypeB+ match the above usages.

----
type TypeA = A (
                field1 : Int
             )
type TypeB = A (
                field1 : Int,
                field2 : String
             )
----


== Ordering with fields

A structure expression with more fields is greater than one with fewer:
+struct(A/2)+ > +struct(A/1)+.

A structure expression with a superset anther's fields is greater:
+struct(A( field1 : Int, field2 : String ))+ > +struct(A ( field1 : Int ))+,
Or: +TypeB+ > +TypeA+

A structure expression with a constructor and with the same or a superset of
anothers fields is greater:
+struct(A( field1 : Int ))+ > +struct(_(field1 : Int))+,

Fields are compared by name and type.  A field whose type is greater than
the corresponding field of another type, is greater.  This makes ordering
composable, and work as desired on recursive types.

Structures whose fields are neither a set or superset cannot be ordered.
Structure expressions with numbers cannot be ordered with those by types.

Widening is performed when a type or a constructor symbol is named,
or if no ordering is found between two types, they are widened in an attempt
to find a common type.
Widening allows more programs to be well typed, makes the type system easier
to use, however it makes type more specific than strictly necessary.

A type expression such as the above is widened to the disjunction of the
equal-least specific types matching the expression.  Nevertheless we
discussed ordering of these expressions so that we can determine ordering of
types and which type an expression may be widened to.
Widening must also respect the types created by type expressions the
developer writes, such as in the declaration of a function:

----
func do_something(...) -> Result | Error
{
    ...
}
----

In this case +Result | Error+ is considered for widening.

== Untagged structures

An untagged structure can be used, but without any other structures within
the same type.  The missing tag must be written with +_+.

----
type TypeC = _(
                field1: Int,
                field3: Bool
             )
----

Uses of untagged structures are not widened unless combined with a named
structure or type containing a named structure.  This makes them feel more
"dynamic" although they simply use type inference heavily.
For example:

----
dict_from_kv_list(map(\x -> _( key = get_id(x), value = x ), list))
----

TODO: I think +:+ is the best operator here, but it conflicts badly with
"has type".  +=+ is also okay.  Arrows can be a problem as the directions
matter, and sometimes you want them one way or the other.

Without needing to declare a type, using an untagged structure like this
implicitly creates one for us.


== Syntax

We've already seen some syntax above.  But I'd like to expand on that now.

Type structures use parentheses +( )+, fields are separated by commas and
the tag may either be an identifier starting with a capital letter or the
+_+ symbol.
Each field separates it's field name from the field type (in
declarations) with a +:+ (meaning "type of").

Deconstructions may be done with fields (using a =, with the new variable on
the left) or by position.  Constructions are done either positionally or
with the field name on the left.

Selection is performed using the +.+ operator, the general scoping operator.

----
x = point.x
----

This may be chained for nested structures.

----
a = struct.field1.next_field.other_field
----

Field update (in an expression) is introduced via the join symbol: +|+

----
new_struct = _( old_struct | field = new_value )
----

Nested fields may also be updated, updating all the structures along the
way.

----
new_struct = _( old_struct | field.next_field.following_field = new_value )
----

Multiple fields may be updated in one expression.
These expressions will introduce fields if necessary (subject to type
checking).
These will also work for tagged structs.

A syntas sugar for state variables in statements will probably be
introduced.

=== Syntax TODOs

.Projection / Explosion / Filtering
Additional syntax could be created to merge structs (exploding one into
a series of updates to another).  Filtering (technically projection) may
also have some use, either to satisfy the type system or to free memory.

.Lenses
Lenses (optics?) provide some additional power not provided here.  It'd be
nice to handle that if possible.

== Co-variance and contra-variance

TODO: I will need to address this to support arrays.
