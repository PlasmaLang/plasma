# The Plasma Code of Conduct

The canonical version of this document can be found
[in the master branch of the plasma repository](https://github.com/PlasmaLang/plasma/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for
all, regardless of level of experience, gender identity and expression, sexual
orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age,
religion, nationality, relationship status or other similar characteristic.

## Contact

If you have any questions or wish to report harassment
you may contact the Plasma community moderators by e-mailing
[mods@plasmalang.org](mailto:mods@plasmalang.org).
This e-mail alias currently
messages Paul Bone only.  Reports will be handled discreetly.

## Rules for conduct

All participants are expected to follow these rules at all times.

* On IRC, github and elsewhere when interacting with other community members,
  please avoid using nicknames and avatars (including overtly sexual
  nicknames and avatars) that might detract from a friendly, safe and
  welcoming environment for all.
* Please be kind and courteous. There's no need to be mean or rude.
* We will exclude you from interaction if you insult, demean or harass
  anyone. That is not welcome behaviour. We interpret the term "harassment"
  as including:
  * Violence, threats of violence or violent language directed against
    another person.
  * Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ablest or otherwise
    discriminatory (including hateful, hurtful, oppressive or exclusionary)
    jokes, language and remarks.
  * Personal insults, particularly those targeted at people in socially
    marginalized groups.
  * Cursing is allowed, but never targeting another user, never in a hateful
    manner, and never using oppressive langauge.
  * Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material.
  * Posting or threatening to post other people’s personally identifying
    information ("doxing").
  * Inappropriate photography or recording.
  * Inappropriate physical contact. You should have someone’s consent before
    touching them.
  * Unwelcome sexual attention. This includes, sexualized comments or jokes;
    inappropriate touching, groping, and unwelcomed sexual advances.
  * Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following (online or in person).
  * Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour.
  * Sustained disruption of community events, including talks and
    presentations.
* Private harassment is also unacceptable.  Whether you're a regular
  contributor or a newcomer, if you feel you have been or are being harassed
  or made uncomfortable by a community member, please contact us (see above)
  immediately.  We care about making this community a safe place for you and
  we've got your back.
* Conduct outside the project may affect a person's elegability to hold a
  position of responsability (eg: code review, moderation).
* Likewise any trolling, flaming, baiting or other attention-stealing
  behaviour is not welcome.
* Remarks and behaviours that may make others less likely to contribute to
  Plasma, whether listed in the code of conduct or not, are also not
  allowed.

## Good ideas for productive conduct

When differences of opinion arise we want to have productive discussions,
here are some ideas for ensuring discussions remain productive and
respectful.

* Respect that people have differences of opinion and that every design or
  implementation choice carries a trade-off and numerous costs.
  Disagreements about such decisions are okay so long as they are productive
  and everyone avoids personal attacks.
* Please keep unstructured critique to a minimum. If you have solid ideas
  you want to experiment with, make a fork and see how it works.
* When providing feedback, ask yourself "Is this code/docs/etc better than
  before?" not "Is this contribution perfect?", particularly for new
  contributors.
* Spamming mailing lists, IRC channels etc can make it difficult for
  other on-topic discussions to occur.  Interruptions like these will be
  moderated if necessary.  We do not forbid small off-topic discussions like
  "How was your weekend?" as they are usually positive for the community.

## Moderation

These are the policies for upholding our community's standards of conduct.
If you feel that a thread needs moderation, please contact the
Moderation Team (see above).

1. Moderators will first respond with a warning for most violations.  If the
   violation is particularly severe mods may exclude someone immediately and
   permanently.
2. If the warning is unheeded, the user will be "kicked," i.e., kicked out
   of the communication channel to cool off.
3. If the user comes back and continues to make trouble, they will be
   banned, i.e., indefinitely excluded.
4. Moderators may choose at their discretion to un-ban the user if it was a
   first offense and they offer the offended party a genuine apology.
5. If a moderator bans someone and you think it was unjustified, please take
   it up with that moderator, or with a different moderator, **in private**.
   Complaints about bans in-channel are not allowed.

* Moderators are held to a higher standard than other community members. If
  a moderator creates an inappropriate situation, they should expect less
  leeway than others.

In the Plasma community we strive to go the extra step to look out for each
other. Don't just aim to be technically unimpeachable, try to be your best
self. In particular, avoid flirting with offensive or sensitive issues,
particularly if they're off-topic; this all too often leads to unnecessary
fights, hurt feelings, and damaged trust; worse, it can drive people away
from the community entirely.

And if someone takes issue with something you said or did, resist the urge
to be defensive. Just stop doing what it was they complained about and
apologize. Even if you feel you were misinterpreted or unfairly accused,
chances are good there was something you could've communicated better —
remember that it's your responsibility to make your fellow contributors
comfortable. Everyone wants to get along and we are all here first and
foremost because we want to talk about cool technology. You will find that
people will be eager to assume good intent and forgive as long as you earn
their trust.

The enforcement policies listed above apply to all official Plasma venues;
including official IRC channels (#plasmalang); GitHub repositories under
PlasmaLang; and all mailing lists under plasmalang.org.  For other projects
adopting the Plasma Code of Conduct, please contact the maintainers of those
projects for enforcement. If you wish to use this code of conduct for your
own project, consider explicitly mentioning your moderation policy or making
a copy with your own moderation policy so as to avoid confusion.
