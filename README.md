# Plasma Language
## *a new programming language*

Plasma is a new programming language for safe and efficent general purpose
use.
It is a statically typed, side-effect free single assignment language
and will have functional programming and concurrent programming features.
It will support deterministic parallel execution.
For a general overview, please visit
[http://plasmalang.org/](http://plasmalang.org/)
It is in early development.

It is free software, distributed mostly under the MIT license, see
[LICENSE](LICENSE).

### Dependencies

You will need:

* A C compiler (C99 on a POSIX.1-2008 environment), I've been testing with
  GCC.  Clang should also work.
* [Mercury](https://www.mercurylang.org/).  I attempt to maintain
  compatibility with 14.01.1 until installation issues on OS X are resolved
  in the newer builds.
* Asciidoc

### Mercury installation

The easiest way to install Mercury is to install the
[.deb packages](http://dl.mercurylang.org/deb/) (on Debian, Ubuntu, etc).

Otherwise download Mercury's [source pakcage](http://dl.mercurylang.org)
and follow the
installation instructions in the
[INSTALL](https://github.com/Mercury-Language/mercury/blob/master/.INSTALL.in)
file.
We've made some
[notes about grades](http://plasmalang.org/docs/grades.html)
that may help with choosing which grades you may need.
There is also a
[README.bootstrap](https://github.com/Mercury-Language/mercury/blob/master/README.bootstrap)
file with Mercury bootstrapping information if you wish to do that, it may
also provide some additional explaination.

### Usage

Make any changes you may need in the Makefile, everything configurable is
towards the top of this file.

Use ```make``` in the root directory to build the project.

You should get:

* src/plasmac - The plasma compiler, compiles plasma (```.p```) files to
  plasma bytecode (```.pz```)
* runtime/pzrun - The runtime system, executes plasma bytecode (```.pz```)
  files.
* src/pzasm - The plasma bytecode assembler.  This compiles textual bytecode
  (```.pzt```) to bytecode (```.pz```).  It is useful for testing the
  runtime.

There are example plasma programs in ```examples/```.  Running ```make
test``` will execute these programs as part of the test suite to ensure that
things are working correctly.
